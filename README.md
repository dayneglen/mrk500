# MRK500

MRK500 is my first project I built at Devmountain.

MRK500 is an eccomerce site where customers can create accounts and buy premium t-shirts. It includes an Admin page where an admin can edit products, add products, and remove products from the store.

Technologies used for this project include React, NodeJS, SASS, Stripe API, PostgreSQL, and Bcrypt for authentification.
